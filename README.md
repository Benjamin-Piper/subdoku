# Subdoku

Welcome to Sudoku, but it's one line and eight numbers are filled in.

## Uh... why?

It's a demo. C# with .NET is commonly used as the backend of web applications at my 2022 work place. Almost everyone I have talked to there has not heard of F#. So I have used this simple game to give them a tour of F# and F# technologies. That's why you'll see `TUTORIAL` comments around. These comments are only meant for newcomers, I assume the experts know what's going on.

**Check out src/App.fs to dive into the code!**
